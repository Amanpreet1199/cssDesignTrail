## Alwasy use rem instead of em

Coz, em's compound on each other. But that doesn't mean you should not use em at all, but use em for margins and paddings things as margin and padding will auto scale based on the
font-size of that element.

## :root is just html element

```css
:root {
}
/* Both these are one thing. */
html {
}
```

```
