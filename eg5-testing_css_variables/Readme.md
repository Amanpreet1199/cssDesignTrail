```css
:focus {
  outline: 10px solid red;
}
/* This is gonna show a border around each element you focus on, and it doesn't affect the document flow at all, so thats pretty cool of it. */
```

```css
:focus {
  outline: 3px solid red;
  outline-offset: 5px;
  /* outline offset basically sets a margin between outline and the element.  */
}
```
