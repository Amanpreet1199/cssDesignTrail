vh, vw are pretty useful, but vmin and vmax is little difficult to understand and find the usecase.

## Knowledge

- vh: viewport height
- vw: viewport width

- 100vh: means 100% of viewport height OR same width as the viewport.

## How vh is different from % ?

It is different as % always refers to the percentage of parent container, but vh is % of the viewport actually everywhere.
